        "Dear colleague,\n\nThe time has finally come for me to depart, and I want to take this opportunity to thank you infinitely once again. I will bring this discovery around the lands, and I will try to save as many people as possible from the Plague.",
        "The cure you discovered will not heal those who have long become undead, but that's not important.\n\nWhat matters is that the undead can be cured, and that alone will be enough to give hope to the new generation.",
        "Of course, I will never stop researching! The spirit of adventure runs in my blood after all, and I believe that despite my age, this body still has some energy left to give! I will continue to wander the world and seek another cure, one that can definitively save these lands.",
        "Will it be just a mirage? Who knows, but I will try nonetheless!\n\nFinally, to conclude, there's one last thing that I want to leave you: an ancient decorated goat horn that I found years ago during one of my wanderings.",
        "I never understood what its original purpose was, but it has a very energetic sound and I've often enjoyed playing it to announce my arrival in dangerous and mysterious places.\n\nAfter what you've done for me, I want to repay you in some way, and as I noticed",
        "it among my belongings, I realized that it was the perfect gift for a colleague like you.\n\nWell, that's all.\nI hope you will like my gift and that you will remember me, because I will certainly remember you.\n\nI am finally ready to",
        "depart not for an end, but for a new beginning, and with the last drop of ink I have left, I wish you happy research and continued success!\n\nMay your light be a beacon for the future of Growsseth!"
