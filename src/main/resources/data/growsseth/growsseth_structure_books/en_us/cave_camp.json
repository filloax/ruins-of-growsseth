        "Research Notes #113\n\nI ventured into this cave in search of new materials and made a rather peculiar discovery.",
        "In a dark corner, I noticed a small colony of fungi. I had never found them in the depths before, but it seems that under these conditions, they thrive in a unique way.",
        "I had planned to continue my journey south, but I think I'll settle near here so I can conduct experiments.",
        "",
        "Day 2\n\nThe fungi proved to be more than just a research subject. Theoretically, in nature, one should avoid bright colors, but I am someone who has never shied away from risks, so I tried experimenting with my culinary skills.",
        "What emerged from my machinations is nothing but a tasty soup, excellent for supplementing my usually meat-based diet!",
        "Who knows, when I leave here, I might even reinvent myself as a cook; I don't recall ever seeing this dish served in the villages I visited during my travels.",
        "",
        "From the rock formations near the shelter, droplets of lava seem to drip from a basin just above.",
        "I chose to mention them now because I narrowly avoided being burned just now, and",
        "so I decided to solve the problem somehow.",
        "As dangerous as they remain, the regularity with which they fall is undeniably fascinating; perhaps I can try to use them to my advantage...",
        "",
        "Day 4\n\nIt worked! It took a while, but with this ingenuity, I can prolong my stay here for a few more days... at least until I run out of meat, as the fungi have already started to tire me.",
        "In any case, once finished here, I will return to the surface; I cannot afford to set aside my main goal for too long."
