        "Dear diary,\n\nIt's been a long time since I've written in these pages, since I moved away from the village to live in the countryside in peace.\nI believe it's been 5 years now.\n\nI never liked being amidst all that chaos;",
        "the coming and going of people, the noise of blacksmiths and gunsmiths, the acrid smell of spirits from the rectory, the heavy footsteps of the guardian, the annoying gossip of the alleyways...\n\nIt was a lifestyle in which I didn't feel comfortable.",
        "Not to mention that many detested my appreciation for these little creatures.\n\nBut now amidst green meadows and tall oaks, I can say I feel at peace and dedicate all my attention to my girls.",
        "You know, bees are misunderstood creatures.\nMany fear them or feel uncomfortable in their presence, but they are completely harmless and are essential to the life of various plants, animals, and even us.\n\nOf course, they'll target you if you try to take their honey.",
        "And who wouldn't?\nTo produce a teaspoon of honey, it takes more than 252 bees working tirelessly for a whole day.\nHow would you feel if someone out of nowhere stole what you've worked and toiled hard for?",
        "But the honey from my bees is so sweet and good that I can't do without it.\n\nBy giving them different varieties of flowers to pollinate, it has also acquired immunity properties against common poisons and intoxications.",
        "How do I get it without being stung, you may ask?\n\n\nHehe, secret :P",

        "",
        "A secret I keep at the bottom of my trunk.\n\nP.S.: Did you know technically bees shouldn't be able to fly? Their wings are too small and their bodies too stubby to take flight.",
        "Yet they fly anyway.\nThat's because bees don't care what men think is impossible.\nOr at least that's what I believe, and it has always given me the strength to continue on my path with my convictions.\n\n                                                                                ~ Melissa"
