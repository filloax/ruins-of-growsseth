        "Research Notes #102\n\nToday I made an unusual discovery. I was about to pitch the tent when I noticed smoke in the distance. Intrigued, I approached the source of the fumes, and to my surprise, it led to the entrance of a forge from the ancient kingdom.",
        "The structure was surprisingly well-preserved despite the years, the stairs were only slightly decayed and allowed me to easily reach the main cavern.\n\nThe room was in excellent condition except for the dust on the tools; it almost",
        "seemed as if someone had tidied up before abandoning it.\nThe only things in bad shape were the anvil, which was about to break from repeated use, and the portal, but the latter is no surprise, in all my years of exploration I have never seen an active portal.",
        "Rummaging through the house next to the portal, I found materials for crafting and repairing weapons, a blueprint with the kingdom's symbol, a sword, and various enchanted books that were probably meant to be applied to it.\nUnfortunately, no trace of fragments.",
        "Too bad, they would have fetched a good price.\n\nFinally, I noticed a book on the forging bench. It was the diary of a soldier from the civil war.\nMany pages were torn, but from what could be read, I deduced that his battalion had been dismantled",
        "because of the Plague, and that after months of trying to survive in the wild, he was the last one alive.\n\nThe diary had been abandoned for practical reasons, so it is not known what fate befell it. In the past, those damn soldiers never did anything good, but this",
        "one didn't seem like a bad person.\nReading the passage about his guilt and nightmares over the recent death of his last companions has reopened old wounds that I thought had closed years ago; I believe the next few days will not be very pleasant."
