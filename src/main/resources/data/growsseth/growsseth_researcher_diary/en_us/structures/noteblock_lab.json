        "Research Notes No. 81\n\nToday I was walking in thought when I heard a melody in the distance. I approached and found an abandoned building, remarkably intact considering its supposed age.",
        "Upon entering, the melody heard before repeated itself, but this time I noticed how certain musical blocks no longer sounded, a true pity that it has deteriorated over time. Suppressing my annoyance at not having the musical skills to notate the notes and reconstruct the score,",
        "Reading the owner's recent writings, he seemed like a very lonely man, who, isolated from society, had only the company of his music and... his spirit...? Who knows if it was there",
        "for him or for his music.\n\nNow that I think about it, I've always been alone for most of my life, and the only company I've had in recent years (excluding recent developments) has been that of my donkey. What does he feel towards me? Is he",
        "attached to me or does he only follow me because it's in his nature to follow the leash?\n\nUh, I'm not used to thinking too much about such trivial things; I'd better focus on something else."
