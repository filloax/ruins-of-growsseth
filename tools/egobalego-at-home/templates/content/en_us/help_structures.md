This is the section for structures, which allows you to spawn the mod's structures wherever and however you want.

There are a few things to know: once you've selected the structure to spawn, you need to set its **coordinates** where you want it to spawn, the **biome variant** in the case of the golem house, and the **rotation**. The latter is simply the rotation of the structure relative to the direction it would normally spawn in ("automatic" lets the game decide).  
<u>Note</u>: to see the base direction of a structure in-game, you can use the _/place_ command as you would normally, as unlike vanilla structures, the rotation of mod structures is fixed.

The mod's structures are set to spawn from the center of their base, making it more convenient for any testing to choose the position. Simply try to position yourself in-game on foot where you want it to spawn, and when you find the right spot, note down the coordinates.

**Important:** as mentioned in the home help (you can go back there by clicking on the site logo if you've forgotten), structures received from the mod do not respawn after the first time. So, when you're testing various coordinates or rotations of a certain structure, remember to create a new one and maybe delete the one that didn't spawn well, otherwise nothing will happen!
