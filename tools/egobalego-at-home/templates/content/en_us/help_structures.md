This is the structures section, which allows you to spawn the mod's structures wherever and however you want.

There are a few things to know: once you've selected the structure you want to spawn, you need to set the **coordinates** at which you want it to spawn, the **biome variant** (only for the golem house), and the **rotation**. The latter is simply the rotation of the structure relative to the direction it would normally face when spawned ("auto" leaves the decision to the game).  
<u>Note</u>: to see how the possible directions of a structure would look in-game, you can use the [_/gplace_](https://github.com/filloax/ruins-of-growsseth/wiki/EN-%E2%80%90-Mod-commands#gplace) command (redirects to the wiki).

The mod's structures are set to spawn from the center of their base, making it easier to test different spawning positions. Simply try placing yourself in-game (on foot and in creative mode) where you want the structure to spawn, and note down the coordinates when you find the right spot.

**Important:** as mentioned in the home help (you can go back there by clicking on the "Egobalego at Home" logo if you've forgotten), the structures received from the mod do not respawn after the first time. So, when you're testing various coordinates or rotations for a certain structure, remember to create a new one and (if you want to) delete the one that didn't spawn well, otherwise nothing will happen!
