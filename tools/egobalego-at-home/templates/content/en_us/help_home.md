Welcome to Egobalego at Home, your personal console for remote mod control!

If you're here just to try it out in your game, you can start right away, as the mod should automatically connect to the server with its default settings (you just need to enable **web synchronization** from the settings). Otherwise, make sure before using the site that you have followed the documentation on GitHub on how to make the server accessible from the outside.

The site is divided into five main sections, accessible from the header:

*   **STRUCTURES**: to spawn the mod's structures into the world;
*   **QUEST**: to activate the steps of the researcher's final quest;
*   **COMMUNICATIONS**: to manage various communications, such as sending notifications, making the researcher say things, making him write diaries or replace pre-set ones, and rewriting the books present in the structures;
*   **TRADES**: to add trades to the researcher's repertoire;
*   **COMMANDS**: to execute manual commands or mod-specific ones.

Please, the first time you enter a section of the site, make sure to **read the corresponding help** first (you can open it from the question marks in the top right corner), and always keep in mind these things:

*   In normal use, for the mod to function correctly, events will trigger only once, even if modified; if you want to change the position of an already spawned structure or the text of a notification, for example, you need to create a new entry!
    <u>Note</u>: this doesn't apply to all events (trades work differently, for example), but if you follow the next point, you won't have any issues;
*   Do not delete events that have been received by the mod; it's advisable to **deactivate them** and **leave them on the page** to keep a history of what you've done (for the same reason as before, even if you leave them, they won't be re-executed).

That's it! If you want to return to the home for any reason, you can click on the site logo, have fun!
